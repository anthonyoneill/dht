\subsubsection{Relief valves}

\paragraph{Safety valves}

A safety valve is a valve that opens automatically when the pressure in the system exceeds a \ 
certain threshold. The resistance of a safety valve has the same form as for a standard valve, \ 
see equation \eqref{valve_resistance}, however the inverse loss coefficient $k_j^{-1}$ is given by
\begin{align}
    \boxed{ 
        k_j^{-1} = 
        \begin{cases}
            0, & \text{if } \Delta P_j \leq \Delta P_{\text{set}}, \\
            k_0^{-1}, & \text{if } \Delta P_j > \Delta P_{\text{set}},
        \end{cases}
    }
\end{align}
where $\Delta P_{\text{set}}$ is the set pressure difference at which the valve opens. This means \
that the safety valve is open when the pressure difference across it is greater than the set \
pressure difference and closed when the pressure difference is less than the set pressure \
difference. The value $k_0$ is the loss coefficient of the valve when it is fully open. For \
steady flow, the safety valve is considered to be closed $(\tau = 0)$, so the inverse loss \
coefficient is zero.

\paragraph{Pressure relief valves}

Pressure relief valves are similar to safety valves, but they open more gradually as the pressure \
in the system increases. The resistance of a pressure relief valve has the same form as for a \
standard valve, see equation \eqref{valve_resistance}. For a pressure relief valve, the open ratio \ 
$\tau$ is a function of the pressure difference across the valve and is given by
\begin{align}
    \tau = \begin{cases}
        0, & \text{if } \Delta P_j \leq \Delta P_{\text{open}}, \\
        f(\Delta P_j), & \text{if } \Delta P_{\text{open}} < \Delta P_j < \Delta P_{\text{full}}, \\
        1, & \text{if } \Delta P_j \geq \Delta P_{\text{full}},
    \end{cases}
\end{align}
where $\Delta P_{\text{open}}$ is the pressure difference at which the valve starts to open, \
$\Delta P_{\text{full}}$ is the pressure difference at which the valve is fully open, and $f$ is a \
function that describes the profile of the valve opening.
