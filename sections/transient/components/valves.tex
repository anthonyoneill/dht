\subsubsection{Valves}

Transient flows in pipe networks may be caused by the closing and opening of valves. In order to describe the transient behaviour of a valves we must define the valve open percentage $\phi(t)$ as a function of time. The valve open percentage is then used to determine the loss coefficient $k$ in the valve resistance equation \eqref{valve_resistance}.

\paragraph{Closing}
 
 The function $\phi(t)$, as shown in figure \ref{fig:valve_closing}, for a valve closure is given by 
\begin{align}\label{valve_closure_function}
\phi(t) = 
\begin{cases} 
\phi_{steady}, &\text{if} \hspace{0.5cm} t \leq t_e \\
\phi_{steady} \left( 1 - \frac{t-t_e}{t_c} \right)^m, &\text{if} \hspace{0.5cm} t_e \leq t \leq t_e + t_c \\
0, &\text{if} \hspace{0.5cm} t \geq t_e + t_c, 
\end{cases}
\end{align} 
where $t_e$ is the event time, $t_c$ is the time taken for the valve to close, $\phi_{steady}$ is the steady state valve open percentage. The exponent $m > 0$ modifies the shape of the closure profile with $m=1$ corresponding to a linear profile.
