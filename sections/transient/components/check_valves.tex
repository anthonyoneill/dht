\subsubsection{Check / Non-return valves}

A check or non-return valve is a valve that allows fluid to flow through it in one direction only. \ 
The resistance of a check valve has the same form as for a standard valve, see equation \ 
\eqref{valve_resistance}, however the inverse loss coefficient $k_j^{-1}$ is given by
\begin{align}
    \boxed{ 
        k_j^{-1} = 
        \begin{cases}
            0, & \text{if } \Delta H_j \leq 0, \\
            k_0^{-1}, & \text{if } \Delta H_j > 0.
        \end{cases}
    }
\end{align}
This means that the check valve is open when the pressure difference across it is positive and \ 
closed when the pressure difference is negative. The value $k_0$ is the loss coefficient of the \ 
valve when it is fully open. For steady flow, the check valve is considered to be open \ 
$(\tau = 1)$, so the inverse loss coefficient is $k_0^{-1}$.
