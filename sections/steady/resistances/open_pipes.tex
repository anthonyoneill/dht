\subsubsection{Open pipes}

Open pipes are pipes that are open to the atmosphere at one end. The discharge relationship of an \ 
open pipe is given by 
\begin{align}
    \Delta H = \frac{K Q |Q|}{2 g A^2},
\end{align}
such that the resistance function is given by
\begin{align}
    \boxed{ R_j = - \frac{K Q_j |Q_j|}{2 A_j} + g A_j \Delta H. }
\end{align}
Here the loss coefficient $K$ is a constant that depends on the geometry of the pipe at the exit. \
See \cite{rennels22} p.131 for details of different $K$ for various geometries.

% TODO do we need to have a different resistance for reverse flow?
