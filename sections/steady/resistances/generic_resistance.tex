\subsubsection{Generic resistance}

Many components may be represented by a generic resistance of the form
\begin{align}
    \Delta H = A + B Q^n + C Q^m,
\end{align}
where $A$, $B$, $C$, $n$, and $m$ are constants. In order to preserve the directionality of the \ 
resistance, when the flow is reversed, we must replace $Q^n$ and $Q^m$ with $Q|Q|^{n-1}$ and \ 
$Q|Q|^{m-1}$, respectively. The resistance function for such a generic resistance may be written as
\begin{align} \label{generic_resistance}
    \boxed{ R_j = - g A_j \left[A + B Q_j|Q_j|^{n-1} + C Q_j|Q_j|^{m-1} \right] +  g A_j \Delta H_j. }
\end{align}
This form of resistance is fairly general and includes many common components when the coefficients \ 
and exponents are chosen appropriately.
